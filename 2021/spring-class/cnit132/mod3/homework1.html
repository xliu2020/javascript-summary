    <p>Hi! My name is Xiaoying Liu. I am learning front-end skills and trying to get the certificate in order to find a front-end related job. I enjoy the process of creating a website and hope that the website I create can help different fields of people to develope their business or spread personal's brand out.</p>
    <p>Currently I have learned HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as framework and library such as Bootstrap and jQuery. There is a lot of fun to explore these new techniques and I am excited to introduce one of my favorite website, <a href="https://www.passionpointcollective.com/" target="_blank">Passion Point Collective</a> to you! This is quite a professional and modern website. It will attract you to read more and is never boring.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.brendandowling.com/home " target="_blank">Another interesting website</a></h3>

    <p>Some websites that might help in web development:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3school</a>: this helps me a lot to understand how does the element works with concrete examples and easy-undestanding explanation. The most important thing is that you can preview the effect of the element we uses, which is good for memorizing these stuff in my opinion.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a>: FreeCodeCamp provides coding exercise for people in different need. No matter you want to develop front-end skills or back-end skills, you can find out what you want in FreeCodeCamp. It helps a lot for learners who start from zero.</li>
        <li><a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/" target="_blank">Flexbox Froggy</a>: this is a game for learning CSS flexbox. The frog is cute and you will have a lot of fun when you learn flexbox. Also, it benefits for memorizing properties with simple defination displayed.</li>
    </ul>
